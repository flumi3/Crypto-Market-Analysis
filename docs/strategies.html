    @staticmethod
    def moving_average_strategy(candlestick_df, quantity=1):
        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        Moving average strategy.

        This strategy includes the usage of 2 simple moving average: A fast moving average which will follow the price
        closely and a slow moving average which follows the ups and downs of the course not as closely.

        The strategy is defined by the following conditions:
            - If the price is 3% below the slow simple moving average, we will buy.
            - If the price is 2% above the buying price, we will sell.

        It creates two lists that will hold our buy and sell signals. Then, it will go through all of the data within
        the passed candlestick data frame and check for every entry whether our buy condition is met. If so, it will
        place a buy signal containing the buying price, the desired selling price and the exact moment in which the coin
        would have been bought. After collecting the buy signals we will go a second time through all of the market data
        in the data frame looking for potential selling points of our bought coins.

        Parameter:
            - candlestick_df: DataFrame - The candlestick market data we will perform the strategy on
            - quantity: int - The number of coins we will buy when our buy condition is met
